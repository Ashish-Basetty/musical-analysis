# musical-analysis

Physics 4BL Final project, analyze music wav files from different genres, using fourier analysis

Features include mean intensities, intensity variance, and means and variances for various frequency bands

GenreAlgorithmv2 uses numpy and data science to achieve a reliablly high prediction success rate

GenreAlgorithmModel attempts to use PyTorch to generate a simple model with a few layers for prediction, taking in the same features as input.
The model likely overfit and was not successful with a small training set of 60 songs, leading to unpredictable results.
